# A place to create...

* a page that's just your game
  * no distractions, like content from the platform that hosts it
* a page that's customizable, make it feel like your own
* a page with quick no-fuss downloads

# itch.io was born

**March 03, 2013** (happy bday)

<http://leafo.net/posts/introducing_itchio.html>

<img src="itchio-old.png" style="max-width: 80%" alt="" />

class: center, middle

# It was uneventful

(It didn't launch with any sort of game jam functionality, just game hosting)

???

* Stuck with it
* There we're so few games at launch I didn't even have a way to browse them all
* Did ludum dare a bunch
* Used that as opportunity to share the site

---

class: center, middle

## Then I saw some internet friends hosting a jam...

<img src="saltw-jam.png" style="max-width: 80%" alt="" />

???

* A jam being organized on a self hosted php forum, as things were done in 2013
* I saw an opportunity
* Put together something hacky
* The first jam on itch.io!
* Wasn't able to find screenshot
* 11 submissions

---

class: middle, center, bgimage
background-image: url(candyjam.png)

???

* I spread word, and there were other people interested
* The next jam
* 432 submissions!

---
class: middle, center, bgimage
background-image: url(flappy.png)

???

* 700 submissions!
* Almost doubled the number of games on itch.io
* I knew I was on to to something
* I like how these two jams had a theme: game developers making a statement about something going on
* itch.io did the same by responding to steam greenlight

---

class: middle, center, bgimage
background-image: url(cyberpunk.png)

???

* The system was sill closed, invite only
* Frantically adding features as jam hosts reached out to me

---

class: middle, center

<img src="tojam.png" style="max-width: 60%" alt="" />

???

* Existing, well known jams were interested

---

class: middle, center

# Then, jams for all

<https://itch.io/docs/creators/game-jams>

<img src="criteria.gif" style="max-width: 50%" alt="" />

???

* Finally, sometime in early 2014 jams were open for all
* I don't know exact date: I deploy before announcing to test for bugs

Ranked jams have to set criteria
* different voting modes
* manual ranking

flexibility is important

---

class: middle, center

<img src="fields.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" alt="" />

ever hear of the phrase 'game jam fatigue'?

# Game jams are great

I enjoyed adding tons of features to make stuff happen

* Custom fields, like the CC0 field for public domain jam
* Email lists to recurring jams could reach out to old participants
* Message boards for jams to run communities
* Moderators and judges to allow teams to run a jam
* Anonymized judge feedback & manual ranking for when prizes are rewarded
* Extracting strings for localization
* Exporting submissions and participants
* Much more...

## Custom support for Ludum Dare

# Jams are easier than ever to host and participate in

???

* enough fluff numbers
* what's the effect of making jams so easy to create?
* many people have often joked that there are too many jams going on
* there can never be too many jams, but we should be creating an ecosystem that encourages people to make successful jams

# Some features

???

That was really vague so here are some real upcoming features

---

# Upcoming features

* "Quality of life" type things
  * Better controls about who can join: approve people before they can join
  * Restricting who can enter/submit based on the kinds of files they have
    * Checking dates of files (people love to abuse jams!)
* Hosting recurring events
* Flexible dates: no end, late submit buffer
* Invite only: control who can see and join a jam
* Devlogs for jams: post about your work in progress before it has become a game

---

# Upcoming features

* Have fine control over when the results are announced, give judges the time they need
* Try to fix public voting (to some extent)
* Individual voting options per criteria
* Rich custom fields
* A nice way to disqualify an entry:
  * Give the host ability to report why entry is disqualified
  * Still leave the jam page up though, but unranked

* & more (tell me your ideas afterwards)
