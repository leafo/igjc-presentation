# The idea for itch.io started out as a place to host jam games

# A place to create...

* a page that's just your game
  * no distractions with other content on that platform that hosts it
* a page that's customizable to feel like your own
* a page with quick no-fuss downloads

# itch.io was born

**March 03, 2013** (happy bday)

<http://leafo.net/posts/introducing_itchio.html>

# It was uneventful

(It didn't launch with any sort of game jam functionality, just game hosting)

???

* Stuck with it
* There we're so few games at launch I didn't even have a way to browse them all
* Did ludum dare a bunch
* Used that as opportunity to share the site

---

class: center, middle

# Then I saw some internet friends hosting a jam...

<img src="saltw-jam.png" style="max-width: 80%" alt="" />

???

* A jam being organized on a self hosted php forum, as things were done in 2013
* I saw an opportunity
* Put together something hacky
* The first jam on itch.io!
* Wasn't able to find screenshot

---

class: middle, center

<img src="candyjam.png" style="max-width: 80%" alt="" />

???

* I spread word, and there were other people interested
* The next jam
* 432 submissions!

---

class: middle, center

<img src="flappy.png" style="max-width: 80%" alt="" />

???

* 700 submissions!
* Almost doubled the number of games on itch.io
* I knew I was on to to something
* I like how these two jams had a theme: game developers making a statement about something going on
* itch.io did the same by responding to steam greenlight

---

class: middle, center

<img src="cyberpunk.png" style="max-width: 80%" alt="" />

???

* The system was sill closed, invite only
* Frantically adding features as jam hosts reached out to me

---

class: middle, center

<img src="tojam.png" style="max-width: 60%" alt="" />

???

* Existing, well known jams were interested

---

class: middle, center

# Then, jams for all

<https://itch.io/docs/creators/game-jams>

<img src="criteria.gif" style="max-width: 50%" alt="" />

???

* Finally, sometime in early 2014 jams were open for all
* I don't know exact date: I deploy before announcing to test for bugs

# Voting options

  * Who can vote: participants, judges, everyone, etc.

---

class: middle, center

<img src="criteria-more.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" alt="" />

???

Ranked jams have to set criteria
* different voting modes
* manual ranking

flexibility is important

---

class: middle, center

<img src="fields.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" alt="" />

???

Fields let hosts collect info about submissions

* public domain jam, Creative commons license
* github game off collects a github url

---

<img src="results.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" alt="" />

# Game jams are great

I enjoyed adding tons of features to make stuff happen

* Custom fields, like the CC0 field for public domain jam
* Email lists to recurring jams could reach out to old participants
* All jams can have a message board
* Moderators and judges to allow other accounts help run a jam
* Anonymized judge feedback & manual ranking for when prizes are rewarded
* Extracting strings for localization
* Much more...

* We also end up hosting games for many jams not on itch.io as well
* About 18k in total with global game jam and ludum dare tags

# Custom support for Ludum Dare

* It's not a competition
* I build features for external jams

---

class: middle, center

# Jams are easier than ever to host and participate in

???

* enough fluff numbers
* what's the effect of making jams so easy to create?
* many people have often joked that there are too many jams going on
* there can never be too many jams, but we should be creating an ecosystem that encourages people to make successful jams

Empty jams? How many jams get no participants, or games?

### Being aware of empty jams can help us build better tools

# Joining wasn't always there

* Originally, you 'joined' when you submitted your entry
* We added joining to allow hosts to keep in touch with people who are interested
  * Hopefully encouraging more people to submit

How many people who join actually submit?

# itch.io, although a useful tool, has codified how game jams are run for many people

---

class: middle, center

# I don't want us to get stuck in a certain way of thinking about how game jams can be organized

---

class: middle, center

## Developers participating in jams are looking for ways to break out of the norm

---

class: middle, center

## It's our (itch.io's) duty to also break the mold when hosting game jams

---

class: middle, center

## I hope itch.io can provide a platform where people can really exercise their creativity for the kinds of events they want to host

---

class: middle, center

# Some features

???

That was really value so here are some real upcoming features

---

# Upcoming features

* "Quality of life" type things
  * Better controls about who can join: approve people before they can join
  * Restricting who can enter/submit based on the kinds of files they have
    * Checking dates of files (people love to abuse jams!)
* Hosting recurring events
* Events with no end
* Invite only jams, invites must be created before someone can see and join
* Devlogs for jams: post about your work in progress before it has become a game

---

# Upcoming features

* Have fine control over when the results are announced, if judges need extra time
* Try to fix public voting (to some extent)
* Individual voting options per criteria
* More rich fields for custom fields
* A nice way to disqualify an entry:
  * Give the host ability to report why entry is disqualified
  * Still leave the jam page up though, but unranked

* & more
